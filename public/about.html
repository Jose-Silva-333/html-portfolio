    <p>Hi, I'm José Luís Silva, a recent graduate in Electrical and Computers Engineering from ISEP with a strong passion for software development and interactive graphic systems. To further enhance my programming skills, I also pursued additional coursework in Informatics Engineering at ISEP, where I gained hands-on experience in web and application development through the development of some projects.</p>

    <p>Driven by curiosity and a strong analytical mindset, I am always eager to expand my programming knowledge and tackle new challenges. I pride myself on being highly organized, responsible, and detail-oriented, with a critical thinking approach that helps me solve complex problems efficiently. Transparency and integrity are core values I bring to any team.</p>

    <p>I'm currently seeking an opportunity in IT where I can apply my skills, contribute meaningfully, and continue growing as a developer. My passion extends to exploring the latest tech and design trends to create intuitive, dynamic, and visually engaging user interfaces. I strongly believe in inclusivity and empathy, striving to contribute to a world that values diversity and fairness.</p>
